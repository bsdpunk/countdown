I originally used this as a geek tool thing for mac, you can see that here:

Well it's another year off my mortal coil, so I have updated it for that time and added it to my github.


Here;s the watch command you could use if use if you were just running it in a terminal window or Conky or something

watch -n1 nodejs countdown.js
